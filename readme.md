## Installation
As the application is under active development you will need to download the program from source and install as a unpackaged extension. We have detailed the steps below for Google Chrome and Edge.

### Installation instructions for Google Chrome: 
1. Install the source files to your local system through git or the zip file. 
2. Open your Google Chrome and type 'chrome://extensions' in your web browser which redirects you to where all your extensions are located. 
3. Enable developer mode and then locate 'Load unpackaged'. You will then need to find the folder with your source code and hit select. 
4. Timebox should not pop up as a extension and you are now all set to begin using it! 

### Installation instructions for Microsoft Edge: 
1. Install the source files to your local system through git or the zip file. 
2. Open your Microsoft Edge browser and on the upper right side find the extensions icon and click **manage extensions**. 
3. Make sure that you enable **developer mode** and you will then see **Load unpackaged**. 
4. Click on **Load unpackaged** and then find your source folder and click add. Timelog is now ready to be used on your local browser.
