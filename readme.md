A simple plugin made for Google Chrome [Pending Approval] that allows freelance workers to keep track of hours worked for the clients that they serve. 

## How to install: 
Our plugin is currently under review by Google Chrome therefore the only way to work on this project is by building it from source. Please take a look at the instructions below to get started:

1. You need to install the source files to your system from this repo or your fork of this repo. You can achieve this through git or by downloading a zip of the files. 
2. Next, open up Chrome, and navigate to chrome://extensions and look for a tab that says 'Load unpacked'. 
3. Once you find 'Load unpacked', you will then need to click on it and find the folder with the source code. Load in that folder and then click where your extensions are located. 
4. Done! Any changes that you make now will be reflected in the extension. You can also find errors within chrome://extensions that will help you when troubleshooting.
