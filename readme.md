# About us 

RatingLog is a upcoming plugin for Google Chrome that helps raters (I.E. TELUS, WeLocalize, Reform, and other platforms) to keep track of their hours worked which are often irregular compared a normal hourly shift. Through RatingLog, you can easily log in your hours and then collect them for later when you submit your timesheets. 

# Installation
This plugin is currently only avaialble through an unpackaged extension. We are finalizing our UI design and bug testing before we release it for free onto the Google Chrome Extension store. For the time being please follow the stpes below to install the extension: 

1. You need to install the source files to your system from this repo or your fork of this repo. You can achieve this through git or by downloading a zip of the files. 
2. Next, open up Chrome, and navigate to chrome://extensions and look for a tab that says 'Load unpacked'. 
3. Once you find 'Load unpacked', you will then need to click on it and find the folder with the source code. Load in that folder and then click where your extensions are located. 
4. Done! Any changes that you make now will be reflected in the extension. You can also find errors within chrome://extensions that will help you when troubleshooting.
